I have used 
React for fronted,
Tailwind CSS for designing,
JWT & bcrypt for handling the authentication and password encryption,
Node & Express.js for backend,
MongoDb for database,


To start the application
frontend - root directory type npm run start,
backend - go to backend directory add the keys and url in .env file then start backent using npm run dev...
